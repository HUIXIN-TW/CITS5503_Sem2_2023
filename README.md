# CITS5503 Cloud Computing

This unit introduces cloud computing as the provision of computing resources. Students are exposed to modern systems architectures and software development kits that, together, provide cloud computing frameworks. Students will learn about different aspects of the design, development, provisioning and management of cloud-based applications.

Students will gain a sound understanding of cloud-based computing and the opportunities that it provides for a diverse range of computing applications. Special attention will be made to security of cloud based applications and the different strategies that are available in these deployments.

An overarching goal of the unit is to provide students with an opportunity to undertake problem identification, analysis and solution and to apply these skills to the field of Cloud Computing.

## Note on the use of AWS
